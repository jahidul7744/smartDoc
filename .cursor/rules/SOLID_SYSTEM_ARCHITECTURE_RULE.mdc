# SOLID System Architecture Rule

## Purpose
Ensure every code contribution across backend and frontend adheres to enterprise-grade engineering discipline, emphasizing SOLID principles and the approved system architecture baseline.

## Scope
- Applies to all backend (Java/Spring) services.
- Applies to all frontend (Angular/TypeScript) applications.
- Covers feature development, refactoring, bug fixes, and architectural changes.

## Core Requirements
- **SOLID Compliance**: Design classes and modules to follow the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion). Document rationale for any unavoidable trade-offs.
- **Architecture Alignment**: Align implementations with the approved senior engineering system architecture. Any deviation requires a documented architectural review and approval before implementation.
- **Cross-Layer Consistency**: Maintain consistent abstractions, naming conventions, and module boundaries between frontend and backend layers to preserve domain integrity.
- **Extensibility First**: Favor patterns that support future feature growth (e.g., strategy, factory, adapter) while avoiding premature optimization.
- **Testability**: Structure code for high test coverage; ensure dependencies can be mocked and behaviors verified in isolation.
- **Documentation**: Capture architectural decisions in ADRs or equivalent records whenever SOLID trade-offs or architectural variances are introduced.

## Enforcement
- Perform peer reviews with explicit SOLID and architecture checkpoints.
- Reject pull requests lacking SOLID compliance justification or architectural approval where required.
- Surface violations in retrospectives and create remediation tasks when necessary.
